###  Introduction

This is implementation for [Battleship game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).
It was created a long time ago for someone's (not mine, I remember whom, but I won't tell anyone) educational purposes.
I had big plans for this project and all other projects which I created, but I realized that I don't want to change them at all.

### F.A.Q.

**Q:** Why code is so weird? Why evrything in one file?

**A:** It's weird because of the constraints that were placed on the project and my desire to do the project my way.
Everything in one file because of the constraints.

**Q:** Why there are so many comments? Why they're in russian?

**A:** As I said this project was created not for me. Moreover the person to whom the project was intended didn't understand programming at all.
That is why I wrote a lot of comments. Half of them are unnecessary for understanding. All comments are in russian, because the person was spoken in russian.

### How to build

I know that it was compiled by Visual Studio 2013 with defaults, so this code is or C++98 or C++99.
Just compile it. `score.txt` stores scoreboard.

### Issues

If you found issue(s), great! I found them a lot, but I don't wanna fix them. Let this project live for its own.
